<h1>THEN LUCK CAME IN</h1>
<div class='tac mb05'>An Aviation Sergeant Who Yearned To Fly</div>
<div class='tac mb10 fs11'>By Andrew A. Caffrey</div>

<p class='ni'>The sergeant was a much
abused man. Wartime flying
had not used him any too well;
nor had after the war aviation
done any better. Now he was nearing the
end of his Army career.</p>

<p>The sergeant had wanted to fly. He
wanted to go solo and do his own birding.
It had always been his one ambition.
And it was through no fault of his own
that the big desire had never been fully
realized. Fact is, along those lines the
much abused sergeant was without fault.
He had always done his share.</p>

<p>The sergeant was too willing in 1917.
Later&mdash;too late&mdash;he realized this. Had
he held off, as the other millions did, and
waited for the war to get at good speed,
he would have made his way into a ground
school and started right. But the sergeant
did not know that there were to be
such schools. None knew this. So the
sergeant enlisted. Willingly the aviation
branch of the Signal Corps took him.
Oh, yes, of course, they said he would
fly.</p>

<p>But the sergeant turned out to be a
handy mechanic. Good mechanics were
few&mdash;and are still&mdash;so the sergeant,
though he didn’t guess it, was never
going to get to fly.</p>

<p>On the other side of the pond his bad
luck continued. That was when they
made him a sergeant, made him a
sergeant, chief airplane rigger, while they
made flying cadets of the goldbricks in his
squadron. That hurt&mdash;hurt like&mdash;well,
it hurt.</p>

<p>“But look here, Sergeant,” his commanding
officer said in rebuttal, “now
let’s be reasonable; it takes years to make
a good mechanic. And only hours to
<i>lache</i> a full fledged pilot; and the stuff of
which airmen are made need not know
anything&mdash;or much. See the point?
You’re important on this field; these other
birds going out as cadets are, as a rule,
culls we’re glad to be rid of. Now get
back to your hangar and feel satisfied that
you are doing your bit, and a hell of a big
bit, Sergeant!”</p>

<p>That line of official chatter did not help
the sergeant at all.</p>

<p>“I’ve heard it before,” he told his
rigging crews. “Doing my bit! Bit be
damned! The effect of my first patriotic
drunk has worn off. What I want to do
is fly and I’m going to!”</p>

<p>The sergeant did learn to fly; but he
“stole” the flying time, begged all the dual
control instruction he could mooch and
waxed mighty handy on rudder bar and
stick. And he learned quickly. You see,
like many other mechanics, he really
knew how to fly before he ever had a ship
in his hands. Once in the air he merely
had to gain the feel of the thing. And he
got it too. He made a takeoff on the third
hop, landed on his fifth.</p>

<p>His job was on a pursuit field&mdash;all
single seater planes. The ship on which
he had learned&mdash;a Nieuport 23&mdash;was a
two place visitor. He was all set to fly
alone. Then, that same day, they took
the 23 away. The sergeant saw red, and
spoke in the same color.</p>

<p>“Cheated again!” he said. “I’m going
into town, get all drunked up and take an
M.P. apart! Wait and see!”</p>

<hr class='tb'>

<p class='ni'>You can not get the sergeant’s
point of view unless you have loved
air and wanted to fly. But if you
had loved air and wanted to fly, you
would have gone to town with him and
helped take a flock of M.P’s apart.</p>

<p>Unofficially grabbing flying time
wherever and whenever he could get any,
the sergeant lived in hopeless hope, if
such a thing exists. But our war lasted
only a day; and once gone it was gone
forever. The sergeant’s field did not go
directly out of business, with the coming
of the Armistice, but his interest in things
did. For him it was the end of everything&mdash;and
nothing.</p>

<p>Then, with the idea of training more
pilots for future wars, headquarters sent
the sergeant’s squadron on to an Avro,
two place, training field. The sergeant’s
interest came back. He stole lots of time,
loved Avros and added acrobatics to his
straight flying. The war after the war
was treating him better.</p>

<p>New made flying cadets came to that
field. Lord! Where did they get such
dubs? The sergeant wondered. From
every orderly room at the center was the
answer. It was a dog robbers’ holiday.</p>

<p>“I’ll get the C.O.’s permission to turn
you loose, Sergeant,” an instructor said.
“You can fly rings round any bird in this
group. I’ll get papers through for you
too; no reason why you shouldn’t get
a brevet. I understand that they’ve
handed commissions to a few 31st men.”</p>

<p>The sergeant said that they had.</p>

<p>For a night, life couldn’t be improved
upon.</p>

<p>Next morning, February 12, headquarters
“washed out” all flying and
called in the Avros. They say that the
sergeant took a lieutenant of M.P’s apart
at high noon of the same day in the public
square at Issoudun. After that, for him,
the world fused.</p>

<p>The sergeant’s outfit came back to the
States. Air Service wanted to hold some
of its best mechanics. At Mitchel Field
they promised the sergeant and some of
his gang that, were they to reenlist for
another stretch, flying would be their
dish for sure.</p>

<p>The sergeant took his discharge. Then
he was tempted&mdash;and fell. He put up his
hand for another hitch. And headquarters
shipped him to Carlstrom Field,
Florida.</p>

<hr class='tb'>

<p class='ni'>New classes of cadets came to
that field. Even one of the cooks
from the sergeant’s overseas
squadron was among them. They were
the worst cadets the sergeant ever saw.
But he worked planes for them; and in
turn, headquarters never did put the
sergeant on flying status. But the much
abused one continued to mooch some unofficial
airwork. So the months of his one
year enlistment dragged by and he came
toward the happy end, the end which
was going to be so welcome because he
did not give a good, bad or indifferent
damn. And he told his C.O. as much when
that worthy asked him whether he intended
to sign up for a third cruise.</p>

<p>“You’re not talking to me, Lieutenant,”
the sergeant said. “For three years I’ve
lived on hope. When I took on this reenlistment,
they promised me, on a stack
of Bibles, that I’d fly. And have I?”</p>

<p>Any number of ex-overseas men could
answer this.</p>

<p>“But this time you will,” the lieutenant
said. “This school has the ships and men
now, and I’ll promise you&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Tie that outside, Lieutenant,” the
sergeant answered, “I’ve heard it all
before.</p>

<p>“By this time next Monday afternoon,
America will have one more civilian on her
hands. And she’s going to collect a mean
problem, too. I’m sore, Lieutenant. I’ve
been cheated too often to smile and turn
the other cheek. This deal I’ve had
handed me by Air Service smells like a
eucalyptus kitty&mdash;&nbsp;See that guy climbing
into that rear cockpit&mdash;” the sergeant
pointed to a plane at the deadline&mdash;“well,
that same jaybird used to be a bum cook
in my outfit overseas. Shane’s his name.
All that feller ever did for American
honor was lap up French booze and make
trouble. He was our ace of aces at it, too.
Shane and me, Lieutenant, have been
two different kinds of soldiers, but today
he’s getting in official flying time and I’m
still begging rides like a raw John Recruit.
Where’s your damn’ justice in
that? I’ll answer&mdash;out for lunch with
two rags around her eyes! Me, reenlist?
In a pig’s eye! Wonder what’s wrong
with that plane.”</p>

<p>The plane into which they had watched
Cadet Shane climb had started for a takeoff,
bounced into the air, fluttered a few
rods and dropped again for a hasty landing.
It taxied back to where they were
standing. It was one of the sergeant’s
ships. At the deadline the instructor,
Lieutenant Black, swung from his front
cockpit, removed his goggles and said:</p>

<p>“Wish you’d look this ship over,
Sergeant. The controls jam in the air.
Bob Watts was flying it this morning and
he had the same trouble.”</p>

<p>“I’ll work her over,” the sergeant
promised. He looked at his watch.
“Four o’clock now,” he said. “You won’t
want to fly any more today, Lieutenant.
She’ll be jake in the morning.”</p>

<p>“That’s O.K. with me, Sergeant,”
Lieutenant Black agreed, and walked
away with the sergeant’s C.O.</p>

<p>Cadet Shane was sore. He had been
robbed of his afternoon period and did
not care who knew that he was burned
up.</p>

<p>“Damn’ funny you guys can’t keep
ships in condition,” he said. “I haven’t
had two hours’ airwork outa this hangar
in two weeks.”</p>

<p>“Too damn’ bad about you, Shane,”
was all the sympathy the sergeant extended.
“If you’re as rotten a flyer as you
were a cook, the field will be the winner if
you never fly.”</p>

<hr class='tb'>

<p class='ni'>For the next hour the sergeant,
with a helper, worked the ship that
went wrong in the air. At the end of
said time he had located nothing wrong
with the controls. Bob Watts came along
during operations and told his story.
Then, just to be on the safe side, the
sergeant sent for the field inspector,
Blackie Milander. He came along and
demanded&mdash;</p>

<p>“Wot’s eatin’ you, kid?”</p>

<p>“This crate, Blackie, was turned in because
her controls froze in the air,” the
sergeant said. “I’ve looked her over, and
my fair haired helper here has looked her
over, and Lieutenant Watts was on hand
and had his say and look, and we find
nothing wrong. The control cables, all of
’em, are O.K. Not a fray on any of them.
The ball socket joint is jake; and the pulleys
are free. Now, you give her the expert
eye, Blackie, and say what’s to be done.
Gladly we pass the buck to you and, if
failing, you muff the torch thus thrown,
well you’ll get burnt.”</p>

<p>Blackie, working till long after retreat,
scratched his head finally and announced:</p>

<p>“Damned if she ain’t got me stopped!
On the ground here, everything’s free.
D’you know what I think, Sergeant?”</p>

<p>“If a thought there be, Blackie, shoot
before it burns you out. What do you
guess?”</p>

<p>“I think that Watts and Black are full
of hop! There’s nothing wrong with this
pile of wreckage, and I’ll give her a clear
bill. Let me O.K. that flying sheet.”</p>

<p>When the hangars opened in the morning
the sergeant’s C.O. was at hand.</p>

<p>“What did you learn about that plane
of Black’s?” he wanted to know. “Anything
haywire?”</p>

<p>“Not a thing, Lieutenant,” the sergeant
admitted. “What say if you and I give it
a hop right now? See if we can locate any
‘bugs’ in the air.”</p>

<p>“We’ll do that little thing,” the C.O.
agreed. “Got a helmet and goggles I can
use?”</p>

<p>While the C.O. waited, and the men
started the plane’s motor, the squadron
clerk came to the hangar for the C.O.
They talked for a few minutes, then the
C.O. told the sergeant:</p>

<p>“I’ll have to call this flight off for now.
There’re some papers for me to sign. I’ll
see you later.”</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes before the first cadet
class reported for the nine o’clock period,
Lieutenant Black came to the line. The
sergeant told the lieutenant all that he
had not learned.</p>

<p>“But I don’t want to pass the buck
too crudely,” the sergeant concluded.
“What’s the matter with us two going
up in the thing and learning what’s to be
learned?”</p>

<p>What the sergeant wanted was more
airwork. He would have taken his flying
on the tail end of a rocket were no other
means offered. The fact that a ship’s
action was in question meant nothing to
him. More than likely the sergeant was
glad that nobody had been able to locate
the kink; test flying is always to the
liking of a real lover of air. The betting’s
even that the sergeant had planned this
moment during the previous night. As
he talked, he talked Black toward the
waiting plane. The instructor was adjusting
helmet and goggles, and his silence
gave consent.</p>

<p>“It’s funny,” he finally said, as they
waited for the motor man to warm the
engine, “but those controls did jam. I
don’t want any of my cadets to get
in dutch through mechanical faults.
They’re bad enough without that. The
Lord only knows when I’ll be able to turn
any of them loose. Such an iron fisted
bunch of shovel apprentices I’ve never
met. They wouldn’t’ve made good K.P’s.
for the wartime <i>kadets</i>.</p>

<p>“And these damn’ Jennies have got to
be right, Sergeant. As right as they can
be, and if they were twice as right as that,
they’d still be all wrong. Climb in and
we’ll take a turn of the field.”</p>

<hr class='tb'>

<p class='ni'>While they were adjusting
the safety belts, Cadet Shane
came running along the line of
hangars. He scrambled aboard Black’s
lower wing and talked into the instructor’s
left ear. Black throttled his motor low,
pushed back his goggles, thought for half
a minute, studied his instrument board
dials, shook and kicked his controls, then
turned to the man in the rear seat and
said:</p>

<p>“Sergeant, I’m going to give the cadet
his hop. These controls seem to be O.K.
Chances are, there was nothing wrong
with them.</p>

<p>“Jump out, Sergeant, and I’ll let you
know how they act. Watch my first turn
of the field and see how I’m getting along.
Climb in, Shane! Let’s get going!”</p>

<p>The sergeant went back to the hangar.
He wasn’t talking to anybody, for the
time being, but he hurled an open can of
red paint the length of the big building
and said to a few idle privates&mdash;</p>

<p>“Clean that up!”</p>

<p>Then, where a group of flying cadets
were busily rolling two small cubes on a
work bench, the sergeant came down in
hot wrath, threw the harmless squares
through the skylight and yelled&mdash;</p>

<p>“Get to hell out of this hangar and stay
out!”</p>

<p>After that the sergeant went out, retrieved
the dice and reestablished the
game. He told the cadets that he was sore
about something but could not recall just
what. After sending the privates off to
goldbrick in the post exchange, the sergeant
mopped up the paint.</p>

<p>Master Sergeant Sciples,
in charge of the hangar, came
along to start the day. Sciples
was spending this enlistment on the construction
of certain souvenirs. And at no
time did he allow hangar work to cut in
on his program. He was an easy boss.
Sciples looked at his sergeant rigger and
came out in language that lay people
erroneously suppose is solely characteristic
of the Marine Corps. Here and
there, without half trying, Master Sergeant
Sciples could extemporize in a
manner that would make the Marine
Corps’ glossary look like a first reader for
morons. Sciples’ language, to say the
least, was able.</p>

<p>“Sergeant,” he said, “one look at you,
you tells me that you haven’t had your
morning flight. When will you forget
this flying stuff and put your mind on
next week’s debut into the outer world?
Why, you&mdash;&nbsp;Snap into it and get wise!”</p>

<p>“But, Sciples,” the sergeant said. “It’s
the same old story. The same thing that
I’ve been up against for three years. And
it makes me mad, Sciples. Hell, if I live
to be a hundred, I’ll never lose this desire
to fly. It’s different with you, you old
decrepit”&mdash;the sergeant was never entirely
tongue tied himself&mdash;“You don’t care
about flying. The bug’s never grazed
upon you. You don’t know the hell and
pain and longing that an egg like me
faces, Sciples. Why, Sciples, this thing of
giving a right arm for something is nothing.
I’d do another stretch in this damn’
Army if I really thought that I’d aviate.
And that is what I call bravery.”</p>

<p>“Crazy as a loon!” Sciples exclaimed.
“Why you&mdash;you don’t know enough
to&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And this was the most cruel thrust of
all, Sciples,” the sergeant went on, “this
thing that came off half an hour ago,
why&mdash;” The hangar’s telephone rang, and
Sciples, with the sergeant still talking,
strolled toward the instrument&mdash;“why,
there I was all set to take off with Black.
Had myself nicely planted in the rear seat,
and who comes out and robs me but my
ex-cook, that rotten cook, Shane, and&mdash;”
There were tears in the thick voice.</p>

<p>For a minute Sciples talked over the
line. In the end he said, “Well that’s
hell,” and hung up.</p>

<p>“What’s hell?” the sergeant forgot his
own troubles long enough to ask.</p>

<p>“Cadet Shane,” Master Sergeant
Sciples said, “Shane, the man who unseated
you, Shane and Black spun into the
ground ten miles from here. They both
burned to death.”</p>
